# ROAR-NET Problem Statements

This repository contains a list of problem statements collected in the scope of

## Contributing

To contribute a problem statement open a pull request with a new problem in the
`problems` folder following the template provided in

Each problem must have its own folder inside the `problems` folder. The name of
the folder should be in kebab-case and sufficiently descriptive, e.g.,
`binary-knapsack` for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, or `tsp` for the Travelling
Salesman Problem.
